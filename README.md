# Long-term Investor Prediction with Machine Learning
A predictive model, with data processing pipelines, to forecast high-potential clients in investment banking, utilizing machine learning algorithms and financial data.

While banks are interested in maintaining their customers, they are also interested in getting new customers. In addition, the banks can only really improve their profit margins by encouraging their customers to make long-term deposits and investments with them. One strategy to do this would be to advertise to the customers via telemarketing calls.

This project will aim to employ machine learning for the task of predicting the efficacy of telemarketing campaigns run by banking institutions.

## Methodology
This project is carried out using the __CRISP-DM__ methodology. This is one of the more popular data science methodologies and is characterized by six important phases, which are as follows:

1. _Business Understanding_,
2. _Data Understanding_,
3. _Data Preparation_,
4. _Data Modelling_,
5. _Model Evaluation_, and
6. _Model Deployment_.

It should be noted that these phases are usually recurrent in nature (i.e., some phases may be repeated). As such, they do not necessarily follow a linear progression.

## Tools
The tools of use for this project include:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Sci-kit Learn
